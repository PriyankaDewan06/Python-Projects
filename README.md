# Python-Projects
I am working on some projects using python language .
###  Project No 1 : Email Validation Using String function
###  Project No 2 : Email Validation Using Regex
 An email is a string or a subset of ASCII characters separated into two parts by @ symbol. The first part contains personal information while the other contains the domain name at which the email is registered. We can validated user email using both string function and regular expression.

##### We develop this program based on three conditions
 1. Email must start with an alphabet and 
 2. All letters on that email must be lowercase
 3. There must be one (@) sign and (.) sign on that mail address


###  Project No 3 : Shutdown app with GUI
